%% Start from scratch
% We like to start with a totally empty workspace in order to avoid
% any strange behavior.

%% Usage of itaCoordinates
% There are a few functions that get you started with the coordinate class.
% After initialization, you have instant access to the coordinates in
% (3D)-cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinates. All coordinate
% transforms are handled in the background, so you do not need to care
% about them anymore. As angles the radians is used in common mathematical
% coordinate systems.

% initialite a list of N data points
N = 20; %#ok<UNRCH>
coord = itaCoordinates(N);

% the number of points can be obtained with
coord.nPoints

% now lets set the x- and y-axis to random values
coord.x = rand(N,1);
coord.y = rand(N,1);
% we set z to a constant value
coord.z = 1;

% now we can examine the data, as cartesian N x 3 matrix
coord.cart      % all data

% or as spherical coordinates, or as single components
coord.sph       % all data
coord.theta
coord.phi
coord.r

% the cylindrical coordinates are somehow related to both other ones,
% allowing to access
coord.cyl       % all data
coord.rho       % together with coord.phi and coord.z

% a certain domain can be forced with the commmands
coord.makeCart
coord.makeSph
coord.makeCyl
% but that is not really needed, just access the desired dimensions.

%% Spherical distribution of points
% Let's make a common set of spherically distributed points, we pick a 
% 5째/5째 (theta/phi) resolution and visualize the result.
coord = ita_generateSampling_equiangular(5,5);
% we can visualize the points in the 3D space
scatter(coord);
% here as later: use your mouse to rotate, pan or zoom the plots

%% Line plot of some parts of the points
% Plot the first 1000 points in the given order. This is useful for
% turn-table measurements, for example:
plot(coord.n(1:1000));

%% Balloon plot to visualize geometries
% We can also plot a balloon stlye plot.
surf(coord);

%% Define basic directivities and plot them
% Some simple directivities, the magnitude is expressed by the radius of
% the plot and the phase is decoded as color.
monopole = 1;
dipole = cos(coord.theta);
% and plot the dipole
surf(coord, dipole)

%% Plot logarithmic magnitude directivities
% Ususally a logarithmic plot is very good to be able to better judge a
% directivity according to human perception.

% first convert the directivity (from pressure to SPL)
dipole_dB = 20*log10(abs(dipole)); % in (dB re 1)
% in this example all calculated decibel levels are negative
% we have to define a given dynamic range that acts as maximum radius
% let's use a dynamic range of 20dB
dynRange = 20;
% get the highest level
max_dB = max(dipole_dB);
% pull maximum value to the chosen dynRange and truncate all
% dB values that are still negative
dipole_dB_plot = max(0,dipole_dB - max_dB + dynRange);
% how does it look?
surf(coord, dipole_dB_plot)

%% Plotting complex directivities (with noise)
% Also complex data can be plotted
data = randn(coord.nPoints,1) + 3i .* dipole;
surf(coord, data);

%% Plot on a unit sphere
% Sometimes it is nice to plot data as color information on any geometry.
% The unit sphere is the most probable choice, but any geometry can be
% chosen.

unitSphere = ones(coord.nPoints,1);
surf(coord, unitSphere, data);
% note that now the color resembles the magnitude of the data

% by the way, the short form does the same:
surf(coord, 1, data)


%% Plotting phase details of the directivity
% To plot the phase on a unit sphere, we need to do some manual work:

% convert the matlab angle (-pi..pi) to positive phase (0..2pi)
phase = angle(data) + pi;
% phase on unit sphere
surf(coord, 1, phase);
caxis([0 2*pi]);
colormap hsv
% here you have to adjust the color axis manually, as the surf plot
% does not know that we are dealing with phase data

%% Plotting data on partial spheres (e.g. half sphere)
% Data on partial sphere is also not very tricky, as the plot rountine
% automatically triangularizes the given mesh.

coord_half = coord.n(coord.theta < pi/2);
data_half = 1 + coord_half.theta .* exp(1i.* 2 .* coord_half.theta);
surf(coord_half, data_half)

%% Opening the areas where we have no data
% It gets even nicer, if we open the area where we have a lack of data. The
% plop factor gives the relative size of the triangles that we destroy
% together with the larger ones.

surf(coord_half,  1, data_half, 'plop', 4)
% The higher the plop factor, the more patches are preserved.

%% Sample plot with lightning and additional parameters
% itaCoordinates.plot hands over all additional parameters to MATLABs
% built-in function 'patch.m', see the property browser for a detailed
% list of available properties.
sampleDirectivity = monopole + dipole + cos(coord.theta).^2;
surf(coord, sampleDirectivity,'FaceAlpha',0.5,'EdgeColor','w');
camlight
% 'doc camlight' tells you more

%% Combine itaCoordinates with itaAudio data objects and make movies
% When dealing with itaAudio data objects, we can use them directly to plot
% a balloon of a specific frequency. Simple movies are very easy to make.
% For better quality, the absolute maximum should be determined and the
% same axes length be chosen.

return; %this is only for the publish() function
% take a lower spatial resolution of 22.5째/22.5째 (theta/phi)
coordSmall = ita_generateSampling_equiangular(22.5,22.5);
% create an audio object
ao = itaAudio;
ao.time = ones(2^8,coordSmall.nPoints);
% and store a cardioid directivity with frequency dependent decay
cardioid = 1 + cos(coordSmall.theta);
ao.freq = bsxfun(@times, 1e4./ao.freqVector, cardioid.');
% apply whiteNoise to the data
ao.freq = ao.freq + rand(size(ao.freq));
% and plot the directivities of this audio object for some frequencies
for freqs = 1000:1000:16000
    surf(coordSmall, ao, freqs)
    pause(0.3);
